  "description": "<h2>About me and my plans<\/h2>\r\n<p>My name is <a href=\"http:\/\/itprism.com\/about\" target=\"_blank\">Todor<\/a> and I am founder of <a href=\"http:\/\/itprism.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">ITPrism<\/a>.<\/p>\r\n<p>I was fascinated by Joomla 7 years ago. Since then the creation of extensions for that CMS is my passion. I would like, with my extensions,\u252c\u00e1 to transform Joomla! in a <strong>magic platform<\/strong> that will be useful for millions of people worldwide.<\/p>\r\n<p>Over the years, <strong>I proved<\/strong> that I can create <strong>interesting<\/strong>, <strong>safe<\/strong> and <strong>useful extensions<\/strong>. I am planning to develop a number of applications that will transform Joomla! in one of the <strong>most valuable CMS platforms<\/strong> around the world, but I need your help.<\/p>\r\n<p>You are the people who will help me to do that. You are the people who will help me to make my dreams come true. With your help, I will make Joomla! a better platform for <strong>content distribution<\/strong>, <strong>business<\/strong>, <strong>e-commerce<\/strong>, <strong>marketing<\/strong>, <strong>social networking<\/strong>, \u00d4\u00c7\u00aa<\/p>\r\n<h2>What I need and what you will get?<\/h2>\r\n<p>I need a small amount (<strong>\u00d4\u00e9\u00bc1,000<\/strong>), which I will use to cover some costs during project development stage.<\/p>\r\n<p>The platform will be <strong>open source<\/strong> and will remain free. Everyone will have the opportunity to take advantage of it. Also, you will get all <strong>icons<\/strong>, <strong>badges<\/strong>, <strong>trophies<\/strong>, which I will provide for free.<\/p>\r\n<p>Besides the gamification platform, you will receive several <strong>rewards<\/strong> from me. This is a little chance to thank you for your support. You can see them on the right side of this page.<\/p>\r\n<h2>The project<\/h2>\r\n<p>The gamification platform provides an easy way to gamify a large part of Joomla! extensions you use. You will be able to create a point system, badges, ranks and challenges for your users.<\/p>\r\n<p>Here are a few examples of how you can use the platform:<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>marketing tool<\/strong> - you can give points when your customers share your products with their friends. When they collect a certain number of points, you will allow them to replace them for your service or product.<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>increasing sales<\/strong> - can distribute badges to your customers. When they reached the definite amounts spent, they will receive badges that they will be proud of.<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>engaging your customers<\/strong> - you may qualify your customers on a leaderboard by a number of points or collected amounts spent. They will spend more money to move up higher in the hierarchy of the leaderboard.<\/p>\r\n<h2>Who will get benefits from the gamification platform?<\/h2>\r\n<p>Anyone who owns Joomla! site will be able to use the platform.<\/p>\r\n<p>I plan to gamify many of the most popular extensions available on J!ED.<\/p>\r\n<p>If you have VirtueMart, JoomShopping or HikaShop, you will be able to use the platform to increase your sales.<\/p>\r\n<p>If you have Kunena Forum or other similar extensions, you will be able to increase the engagement of user. You can also use the platform to increase activity on your forum.<\/p>\r\n<p>If you write blog posts and want to reach more people, you can <strong>gamify your blog<\/strong>. This will <strong>increase the engagement<\/strong> of your readers. They will <strong>share your articles<\/strong>, will leave <strong>more comments<\/strong> and your <strong>traffic<\/strong> will jump to the sky.<\/p>\r\n<p>If you want your users to complete their profiles, you <strong>can motivate<\/strong> them by <strong>using game mechanics<\/strong> (statusbar, badges, points, ...)<\/p>\r\n<p>If you are a developer and want to <strong>gamify your extensions<\/strong>, you can take advantage of the <strong>Gamification API<\/strong>. That is application programming interface, which you can use to <strong>gamify Joomla<\/strong> quickly and easily.<\/p>\r\n<h2>Will I develop a paid version?<\/h2>\r\n<p>The platform will be <strong>completely free<\/strong>. The code will be posted on <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/ITPrism\">ITPrism GitHub repository<\/a>. Everyone will be able to download, change and improve.<\/p>\r\n<p>The code will be released under the <strong>GPL license<\/strong>.<\/p>\r\n<p>In the future, I will develop paid extensions that will gamify commercial Joomla! application. This will be necessary if I pay for some of them.<\/p>\r\n<h2>Will I provide a support?<\/h2>\r\n<p>I will provide <strong>free<\/strong> and <strong>premium support<\/strong>. I am planning to focus on <strong>Joomla gamifying<\/strong> and I will provide support for all extensions for a very long time.<\/p>\r\n<h2>When will it be completed?<\/h2>\r\n<p>A lot of this is ready. I can publish a stable version by the end of May. You can find the code on the <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/ITPrism\/GamificationPlatform\" target=\"_blank\">Gamification Platform GitHub repository<\/a>.<\/p>\r\n<h2>Which are the ways you can contribute to the project?<\/h2>\r\n<p>You can <strong>invest in this project<\/strong> amount you want. In return, you will receive one of the <strong>rewards<\/strong> shown on the right side of this page. In addition, you will receive \"<strong>shares<\/strong>\" for your investment. If the product that I am planning to develop brings me income, I will redeem your shares and you will get <strong>your money back<\/strong>.<\/p>\r\n<p>Also, you can support the project and <strong>share it<\/strong> with many of your friends and acquaintances. I will be happy if any of them liked it and wanted to invest in it. You can <strong>use the buttons for sharing<\/strong>, who are on the top of the page.<\/p>",
