Since then the creation of extensions for that CMS is my passion. I would like, with my extensions,┬á to transform Joomla! in a <strong>magic platform</strong> that will be useful for millions of people worldwide.</p>\r\n<p>Over the years, <strong>I proved</strong> that I can create <strong>interesting</strong>, <strong>safe</strong> and <strong>useful extensions</strong>. I am planning to develop a number of applications that will transform Joomla! in one of the <strong>most valuable CMS platforms</strong> around the world, but I need your help.</p>\r\n<p>You are the people who will help me to do that. You are the people who will help me to make my dreams come true.

This is a little chance to thank you for your support. You can see them on the right side of this page.</p>\r\n<h2>The project</h2>\r\n<p>The gamification platform provides an easy way to gamify a large part of Joomla! extensions you use. You will be able to create a point system, badges, ranks and challenges for your users.</p>\r\n<p>Here are a few examples of how you can use the platform:</p>\r\n<p><strong>marketing tool</strong> - you can give points when your customers share your products with their friends. When they collect a certain number of points, you will allow them to replace them for your service or product.</p>\r\n<p><strong>increasing sales</strong> - can distribute badges to your customers. When they reached the definite amounts spent, they will receive badges that they will be proud of.</p>\r\n<p><strong>engaging your customers</strong> - you may qualify your customers on a leaderboard by a number of points or collected amounts spent. They will spend more money to move up higher in the hierarchy of the leaderboard.</p>\r\n<h2>Who will get benefits from the gamification platform?</h2>\r\n<p>Anyone who owns Joomla! site will be able to use the platform.</p>\r\n<p>I plan to gamify many of the most popular extensions available on J!ED.</p>\r\n<p>If you have VirtueMart, JoomShopping or HikaShop, you will be able to use the platform to increase your sales.</p>\r\n<p>If you have Kunena Forum or other similar extensions, you will be able to increase the engagement of user.

This will <strong>increase the engagement</strong> of your readers. They will <strong>share your articles</strong>, will leave <strong>more comments</strong> and your <strong>traffic</strong> will jump to the sky.</p>\r\n<p>If you want your users to complete their profiles, you <strong>can motivate</strong> them by <strong>using game mechanics</strong> (statusbar, badges, points, ...)</p>\r\n<p>If you are a developer and want to <strong>gamify your extensions</strong>, you can take advantage of the <strong>Gamification API</strong>. That is application programming interface, which you can use to <strong>gamify Joomla</strong> quickly and easily.</p>\r\n<h2>Will I develop a paid version?</h2>\r\n<p>The platform will be <strong>completely free</strong>.
